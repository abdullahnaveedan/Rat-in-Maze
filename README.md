# Rat in Maze Problem Solving Using C++

This program solves the classic Rat in a Maze problem using Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm. The maze is read from the `input.txt` file, where the maze matrix is given with '0' representing the open path and '1' representing a blocked path. The rat navigates from the source to the destination, finding a valid path.

## How to Use

1. Create an `input.txt` file with the maze matrix (0s and 1s).
2. Compile and run the `source.cpp` program.
3. The program will find and print a path from source to destination if possible.

## Features

- Utilizes DFS algorithm for maze traversal.
- Input maze is read from a text file.
- Output path is displayed in the console.

Feel free to use and modify the code according to your needs.

> Note: This implementation assumes that the maze is represented as a 2D matrix, and the source is at (0,0), and the destination is at the last cell.
